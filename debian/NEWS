laptop-mode-tools (1.64-1) unstable; urgency=low

  With this version, Laptop Mode Tools introduces a basic graphical
  configuration tool to enable/disable different modules. The GUI is
  written in Python/QT4, thus those packages have been added to the
  Recommends section. If you do not intend to use the graphical 
  utility, you can choose to not install the Python QT4 recommends
  .
  This release will also touch all the configuration files. In case
  you have heavily modified configuration files, you may want to
  verify your configuration after the installation is complete
  .
  This could also be the right time to migrate your custom settings 
  to the /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/board-specific/ folder
